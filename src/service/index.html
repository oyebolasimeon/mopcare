                This intervention is directed towards communities and it is sustained by the pool of volunteers in that
                community so as to ensure community ownership and sustainability.<br /><br />
                We have held four monthly episodes in Abeokuta and a new chapter will soon begin in Lagos and it is
                expected to be replicated globally, as we plan to involve CDAs (Community Development Associations) in a
                way to encouraging them to take up such local initiatives for their seniors.<br /><br />

                The successes of our interventions have become a foundation and an actionable blueprint for subsequent
                results with certainty, auto- reproducibility and predictable quality in service delivery.<br /><br />
